In this project, we decided to keep a vector clock for each key with in the kvs. 
we did this, since we are comfortable with the structure and behaviors of vector clocks.
we also keep a clock for each variable, in order to track conflicting requests vs non conflicting requests.
We deemed it unnececary to make a system for tracking if a node goes down or not. We found that we didn't 
really need to know if a certain node went down. When that node goes back up we'll eventually catch it back up
using our gossip system that we use to sync all the nodes up every three seconds. With this system, and the client holding causal metadata,
we don't need to think about causal consistency breaking due to nodes going down. We also don't have to worry about the replication protocol,
we used a form of quorum replication, since the client will let us know if we're behind and need more information. In summary, 
we track causal consistency using vector clocks for each key, and we did not implement a system for checking if nodes go down, since we do not 
really care if a node goes down.
